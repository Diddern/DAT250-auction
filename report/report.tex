\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
The motivation for using Amazon Web Services in a serverless architecture is that the overhead of running servers are becoming obsolete in modern day web development.
Previously a developer had to think of infrastructure and scaling for the application. Today hosing in the cloud can reduce the time before an application hits marked drastically. There are also reduced security and stablility concerns, because the security of platform and infrastructure is handled by the cloud provider. The cloud provider ultimatly has more resources for handeling infrastructure than a small to medium business.
