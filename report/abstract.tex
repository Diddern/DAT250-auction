\noindent This is the report for the DAT250 cource at Bergen University College. During this project we have implementet a part of an online auction using Amazon Web Services as a platform for building a serverless application.
This was compared to an application we implemented in Jave Enterprise Edition with Glassfish.
Due to time restrictions we only had time to implement parts of the application in Amazon Web Services.
